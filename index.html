      <p>Pokeeee Celinaaaa,</p>
      <p>Happy National Girlfriend Day!!! I hope this makes you smile 7,800 miles awayyyy. Thank you for the past nine months(basically ten now) I have been overwhelemed with joy! You've treated me with a lot of kindness and patience and I really appreciate all the cute things you do for me. I want to see the world with you and explore many countries! I want to build a home and family with you one day but first lets have a good time taking care of our small family(Me, You, Evie!!!!). Most of all I want to make sure I make your day better just a little bit everyday so you have the motivation to keep pursuing all your dreams and goals! I hope you enjoy your remaining time in Japan and Taiwan, ill treat you to delicious food when you come back! ðŸ’–</p>
