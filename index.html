      <p>My loveeeee,</p>
      <p>I made this small corner of the internet just for you. I hope this letter makes you smile wherever you are. Thank you for the past nine months(basically ten now) I have been overwhelemed with joy! You've treated me with a lot of kindness and patience and I really appreciate all the cute things you do for me. I want to see the world with you and explore many countries! I want to build a home and family with you one day but first lets have a good time taking care of our small family(Me, You, Evie!!!!). Most of all I want to make sure I make your day better just a little bit everyday so you have the motivation to keep pursuing all your dreams and goals! ðŸ’–</p>
      <p>I love you always,<br/>Albert Du</p>
